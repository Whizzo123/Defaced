# UkieGameJam2020Project
Repository for Team ZombieCrunch for the Ukie Game Jam
Coding Conventions:-

Use CamelCase (Variables => myVariable, Functions => MyFunctions & Classes => My_Class)
Use brackets on all selection blocks
Try to avoid comments use clean and concise code instead
Good naming conventions
Engine Conventions:-

Ordering in the hierarchy
Put stuff in folders based on purpose
Fix layout crash:-

Delete current layout under Library folder in "...SpookGameJam\Library\CurrentLayout-default.dwlt"
Create another empty project in unity then close it
Go into that empty projects library folder and copy its current layout tile (NewUnityProject\Library\CurrentLayout-default.dwlt)
Paste this file back into SpookGameJam\Library folder then restart unity and the issue should be fixed
