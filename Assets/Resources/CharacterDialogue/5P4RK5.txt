C: If I rewire… increase the power… reroute the turbine… I can increase EFFICIENCY.
But I mustn’t. Everyone must be the SAME… 
M: Whoa. I’ve never been to this side of the factory before.
C: Hey YOU! You look… DIFFERENT! 
Maybe you can HELP me?
M: Are you the person who’s in charge of this sector? 
Are you the one electrocuting everyone?
C: ELECTROcuting!? Oh MY! I would never dream of such a thing! 
M: But there’s high voltage everywhere here. Someone could get hurt!
C: No no no, you’ve got the wrong impression. 
It’s just my experiments... I’m trying to help, but sometimes they go WRONG. 
M: So you’re not trying to hurt anyone?
C: No no no, I’m not like that at all. 
I just want to focus on my experiments.
...
Sometimes I wish I could...not have to worry about others. Be normal. I’m never able to fit in.
M: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with you. You’re just interested in other things.
C: I wish I could find somewhere where I can be myself. 
M: I’m looking for that too! Come with me, we might be able to find it together. 
C: Oh THANK YOU! 
Here, take this. I don’t want to lose it in my mess and I don’t need glasses to look at the trees.
